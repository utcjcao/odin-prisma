# odin-prisma

This project is a basic cloud storage app built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma. Users can securely log in
using Passport.js, upload files, organize them into folders, and view file details like name, size, and
upload time. Files are stored in Cloudinary for easy access and management. The app offers a simple and
effective way to manage personal files with session-based authentication and cloud storage integration.

Things I learned: how to use prisma to shorten commands, improved my route handling skills (learned how to use multer and cloudinary)

Things I struggled with: how to correctly connect middleware, and how to properly migrate prisma schemas.

To use:

1. Sign up an account and log in.

2. Navigate to user files.

3. Upload, delete, download as many files/folders as you want!

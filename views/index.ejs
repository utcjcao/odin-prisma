                This project is a basic cloud storage app built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma. Users can securely
                log in
                using Passport.js, upload files, organize them into folders, and view file details like name, size, and
                upload time. Files are stored in Cloudinary for easy access and management. The app offers a simple and
                effective way to manage personal files with session-based authentication and cloud storage integration.
